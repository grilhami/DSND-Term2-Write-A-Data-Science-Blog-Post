## Motivation

While many people has considered the space as the "final frontier", I considered the ocean as the "forgotten frontier" that we have yet 
to explore here on earth. I mean we have more people who have been to the moon than to the Mariana Trench - the deepest part of the 
oceans. There is so much we don't know about the ocean. Although the surface area of the Pacific Ocean is wider than the moon, according 
to the NOAA, more than 80% of the world's vast underwater oceans are still unmapped, unobserved, and unexplored.

Knowing all of that, I think it only make sense for use to get to know more about our own ocean. Why is it so important? I thinkg it's
better to let the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) explain to you in [this page]; but for me personally it's about
the technological aspect. There are so many things we've invented thanks to the scientists and engineers who helped sent people to the 
moon. For example, the portable computer, wireless headphones, LEDs, and much more. If we could develop such wonderful stuff from space 
exploration, imagine what we could discovered from exploring the ocean.

In this project, we are going to use the NOAA deep-sea coral dataset to....wait for it...build a coastal research resort. The long-term
goal of the research resort is to provide a suitable location for Mariana Trench realted missions; but for the short-term goal, we want 
to provide suitable location and facilities for deep-sea coral research. Why Mariana Trench? And whar does it have to do with corals? 
Well I think it would be better for you you to read my medium blog about this project. It will come out soon, so make sure you stay 
tune.

## File Description

To get the dataset, please refer to https://www.kaggle.com/noaa/deep-sea-corals.

This repository contains a notebook called **Deep Sea Corals.ipynb**, which contains all the main content of the project and analysis.

In the **images** folder, which contains some images for the README and a folder name **visualizations** which containes all the 
visualizations generated from plotly.
